    "# Kattis (https://open.kattis.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "- throughout these notebooks, you'll find Kattis problems listed under each chapter where appropriate\n",
    "- Kattis is a free problem bank and online judge that is widely used in [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/) around the world\n",
    "- Kattis is a great tool to learn various programming languages while solving myriad of intuitive algorithmic problems and developing problem solving skills that are sought after by many potential employers\n",
    "- research (https://rambasnet.github.io/pdfs/kattis.pdf) has shown that by introducing and assigning Kattis problems motivates students to continuously use Kattis and solve more problems there by becoming an effective problem solver -- a hallmark skill of computer scientist\n",
    "- here's a repository of some sample solutions provided in various languages with automated test cases: https://github.com/rambasnet/KattisDemos\n",
    "    - eventually (by Chapter 7), you'll be able to understand and use the all the programming concepts used in those demo solutions\n",
    "- use Kattis provided help to get your started: https://open.kattis.com/help\n",
    "- you must create a free acount here: https://open.kattis.com/login to be able to submit your solution so the Kattis can judge it providing you the verdict\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Kattis provided samples\n",
    "- one way to check for the sample input and output is by manually typing the input and comparing the results\n",
    "    - input can be long and output can be tedious to compare\n",
    "    - Kattis expects output to be 100% accuracte to the space (except for floating point numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Kattis-CLI tool\n",
    "- Kattis provides a command line tool to download problems, test your solution against sample test cases, and submit your solution directly from the terminal\n",
    "- Setup kattis-cli for the Lab Codespace by clicking on and following [https://coloradomesa365-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/rbasnet_coloradomesa_edu/ESYiqurabGZJrIKmpCT4FnEBcw25QfcGjk_HK5PnRYbveA?e=xVLbe9](https://coloradomesa365-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/rbasnet_coloradomesa_edu/ESYiqurabGZJrIKmpCT4FnEBcw25QfcGjk_HK5PnRYbveA?e=xVLbe9)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download problem sample data and metadata\n",
    "- you neeed problem id to download the problem samples and metadata\n",
    "    - problem id can be found in the URL of the problem page, e.g. for https://open.kattis.com/problems/carrots, the problem id is `carrots`\n",
    "- kattis-cli will create a folder with the problem id name and download all the sample input and output files along with problem metadata inside that folder\n",
    "- steps to download and test Kattis problems using kattis-cli:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd <path to your working directory>\n",
    "ls\n",
    "kattis get <problem_id>\n",
    "ls\n",
    "cd <problem_id>\n",
    "ls\n",
    "touch <problem_id>.cpp\n",
    "# create your solution in the above .cpp file using your favorite editor\n",
    "kattis info\n",
    "kattis test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manually Downloading and Testing Kattis problems\n",
    "- download the samples provided in a compressed `.zip` file\n",
    "- unzip the file; it'll create a folder with the same name as the problem name or zip file name\n",
    "- create a `problem_id.cpp` solution file inside the same folder where the sample files are\n",
    "- then do the following steps:\n",
    "    - open a terminal on Mac/Linux/WSL\n",
    "    - change working directory to a problem folder, e.g. carrots\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        pwd\n",
    "        cd <path to carrots folder>\n",
    "        ls\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - directly compile using g++ or create and use a Makefile\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        g++ -std=c++17 carrots.cpp\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - run Kattis provided sample test cases e.g. if 1.in and 1.ans are corresponding sample test files\n",
    "    - read the sample 1.in and pipe it to `a.out` program and pipe the answer from the program to diff to compare against 1.ans\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        cat 1.in | ./a.out | diff - 1.ans\n",
    "        cat 2.in | ./a.out | diff - 2.ans\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    - if the program's answer is correct, you'll not see any difference or output on the terminal\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Morevoer, you can add these commands into your Makefile\n",
    "    - create a rule let's say kattis\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    kattis:\n",
    "        cat 1.in | ./a.out | diff - 1.ans\n",
    "        cat 2.in | ./a.out | diff - 2.ans\n",
    "        @echo \"All test cases passed!\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - run the rule from Terminal\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    make kattis\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- once your program provides correct result as shown in the corresponding output, upload your `.cpp` source file to the Kattis to test against all the hidden test samples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kattis will compile and execute your program to test against other samples\n",
    "- Kattis will either accept your solution or reject with some simple feedback such as wrong answer"
