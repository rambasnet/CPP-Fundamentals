    "- we've used library header files such as `iostream`, `string`, etc.\n",
    "- the purpose of this chapter is to learn how to create your own header files and why\n",
    "- as program grows bigger, code need to be divided into many files\n",
    "- using function prototype (forward declaration) and defining functions after main is not scalable\n",
    "- breaking solution code into many files and organizing into logical folders has many advantages:\n",

    "    - makes it easier to work in a team where each member works on a separate file\n",
    "    - avoid conflicts while using version control such as git\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally, header files allow us to put declarations in one or more files and then include them wherever we need them\n",
    "    - this can save a lot of typing in multi-file programs by avoiding repetitive declarations\n",
    "    - allows us to separate interface (declarations) from implementation (definitions)\n",

    "project_root/\n",
    "├── build/        # Generated build artifacts (object files, executables, etc.)\n",

    "### Key Organizational Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separate Interface from Implementation** \n",
    "    - a primary principle is to distinguish between public headers (your library's API) and implementation files.\n",
    "    - `include/`: \n",
    "        - contains all public header files (e.g., my_lib/my_class.h)\n",
    "        - when your project is installed or used as a library by other projects, only the contents of this folder are exposed.\n",
    "    - `src/`: \n",
    "        - contains all source files (.c or .cpp) and any private headers that are only used internally within your project\n",
    "- **Consistent Naming Conventions**\n",
    "    - Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files and directories.\n",
    "    - Example: Use lowercase with underscores for file names (e.g., my_class.h, my_class.cpp).\n",
    "    - files and folders should not have spaces or special characters (except underscores) in their names\n",
    "- **Logical Grouping**: \n",
    "    - Group related files together in the directory structure.\n",
    "- **Mirror Namespace/Module Structure** \n",
    "    - Within `src/` and `include/`, it is good practice to use subdirectories to mirror your project's logical modules or namespaces.\n",
    "        - Example: For a package named Game with a Player class, you would have `include/Game/Player.h` and `src/Game/Player.cpp`.\n",
    "        - This allows you to use clear include directives like `#include \"Game/Player.h\"`, making dependencies explicit and preventing name collisions with other libraries\n",
    "- **Out-of-Source Builds**\n",
    "    - Always use a dedicated `build/` directory for generated files. This keeps your source tree clean and allows you to easily delete all build artifacts without affecting your source code.\n",
    "- **Organize by Functionality**: \n",
    "    - For larger projects, break your code into logical modules (e.g., `src/core`, `src/graphics`, `src/physics`). This promotes separation of concerns.\n",
    "- **Keep Tests Separate**: \n",
    "    - Placing tests in their own `tests/` directory keeps them isolated from the main source code.\n",
    "- **Small Projects**:\n",
    "    - For very small projects with only a few files, a single folder for everything might be sufficient to start. \n",
    "    - The structure should scale with the project; don't add complexity (extra folders) until you need it.\n",
    "- By following these guidelines, your C/C++ project will be more maintainable and easier for other developers to understand and work with.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Creating header files\n",
    "- header files typically contain declarations of functions, classes, structs, constants, macros, etc.\n",
    "- header files do NOT contain function definitions or implementations\n",
    "- header files have `.h` (C language) or `.hpp` (C++ language) extension\n",
    "- header files contain only declarations and no executable code\n",
    "- header files include preprocessor directives to avoid multiple inclusions\n",
    "- syntax for include guard: \n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "    #ifndef HEADER_FILE_NAME_H\n",
    "    #define HEADER_FILE_NAME_H\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Declarations go here\n",
    "\n",
    "    #endif // HEADER_FILE_NAME_H\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `HEADER_FILE_NAME_H` is a unique identifier, typically the header file name in uppercase\n",
    "- better syntax using `#pragma once` (non-standard but widely supported):\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "    #pragma once\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Declarations go here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- header best practices:\n",
    "    - must contain header include guards (to avoid being included multiple times in the final binary)\n",
    "    - typically contains struct and class definitions only\n",
    "    - contains function prototypes\n",
    "    - avoid function definitions\n",
    "    - may include other header files\n",
    "    - do NOT declare global variables \n",
    "    - each header file should be as independent as possible with specific purpose\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Implementing header files\n",
    "- typically a header file is implmented in a separate corresponding .cpp file\n",
    "- functions and classes are implmented or defined in implementation files\n",
    "- implementation file are regular .cpp files that must include the header being implemented\n",
    "- must also include any library header files required to implment the functions\n",
    "- syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "    #include \"header_file_name.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- note the double quotes `\"header_file_name.h\"` instead of `<>` `<header_file_name.h>` used for built-in headers\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Using header files\n",
    "- include user-defined header files similar to library header file\n",
    "- include only the header files that are required\n",
    "- syntax:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "    #include \"header_file_name.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "- use the functions and user-defined types, etc. defined in the included header file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compiling multiple cpp files\n",
    "\n",
    "- header files are not compiled; ONLY the CPP files\n",
    "- compiling multiple file is similar to compiling single file using g++ compiler\n",
    "    - simply list all the .cpp files separated by a space\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    g++ <switches: -std=c++17, -Wall, etc.> -o program_name input_file1.cpp input_file2.cpp ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "- or use the Makefile as shown in the following demo programs\n",

    "- a simple demo program with one header file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo 2``\n",

    "- contains several header and cpp files\n",
    "- a single-file `triangle.cpp` program provided in File IO chapter - `demos/file_io/triangle/` is separated into several `header` and `cpp` files\n",
    "- test functions are separated into `test.h` and `test.cpp` files\n",
    "- utility functions are separated into `utility.h` and `utility.cpp` files\n",
    "- main entry/driver function is in `main.cpp` file\n",
